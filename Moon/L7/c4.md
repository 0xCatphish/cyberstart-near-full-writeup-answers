```python
#
# One of the agents has intercepted a file from the aliens
# The flag is hidden in large amount of non alphanumeric characters.
# The file lives at /tmp/destroymoonbase.gif
#

import re

basefile = open("/tmp/destroymoonbase.gif", "r")
contents = basefile.read()
p = re.compile("[a-zA-Z0-9]")

print(''.join(p.findall(contents)))
