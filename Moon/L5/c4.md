# Write a script to generate a passphrase by taking words from
# /tmp/words.txt
# The wordNumbers array holds three random numbers. Each number
# corresponds to a word in words.txt. So for example
# wordNumbers[1] is the second word in /tmp/words.txt.
# Put a space between each word and print it out
#
