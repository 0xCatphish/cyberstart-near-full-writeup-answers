Encryption key

**From:** Agent J

**To:** CPA-6S1QPB3

Hey recruit,

Here's the key you need to encrypt the message (the letters on the left should be encrypted to the letters on the right:

A = F  
B = G  
C = H  
D = I  
E = J  
F = K  
G = L  
H = M  
I = N  
J = O  
K = P  
L = Q  
M = R  
N = S  
O = T  
P = U  
Q = V  
R = W  
S = X  
T = Y  
U = Z  
V = A  
W = B  
X = C  
Y = D  
Z = E  

And the message you need to encrypt and send is:

GANG MAY KNOW YOUR IDENTITY ABORT ABORT MEET AT SAFE HOUSE B

Regards, J
