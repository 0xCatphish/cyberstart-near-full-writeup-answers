should I write a script to automate this?

...yeah, it goes over 100

`curl -X GET --cookie "speek_sess_id=1" https://wespeektogether.com/thedazman/status/74635478354`
alright...
python help me

```python
import os

for i in range(1,100):
	print(i)
	os.system("curl -X GET --cookie \"speek_sess_id="+str(i)+"\" https://wespeektogether.com/thedazman/status/74635478354")
```
	
I'm a lazy sloth when it comes to python, I just love writing inefficient code and letting my my computer chug along.
