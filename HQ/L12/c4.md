some things are beyond my knowing

This challenge sucks

```python
for secret in stuff:
    secret = secret.strip().encode("utf-8")
    if secret[-1:] == "\n":
        print(
            "Error, new line character at the end of the string. This will not match!"
        )
    elif len(secret) >= 32:
        print("Error, string too long. Must be less than 32 characters.")
    else:
        
        cipher = AES.new(secret + (BLOCK_SIZE - len(secret) % BLOCK_SIZE) * PADDING)

        
        decoded = DecodeAES(cipher, encrypted)
        print(decoded.decode("utf-8", errors="ignore") + "\n")
```

somehow... just somehow you get the flag from running this...

I'm appalled at how bad cyberstart challenges are

their flags don't even have a format smh

19 character flag and then somehow there are 12 character flags as well?

"We really need to confirm the exact date"

I spent lots of time searching for a month...
