I'll have to add some php parameters here
https://programmingtips.net/1585-php-adding-parameters-to-a-url-in-php.html
![[Pasted image 20211210154041.png]]
oh, I have to url encode...
![[Pasted image 20211209170820.png]]
`https://118.279.0.1/login?user=%3Croot%3E`
url encode
...
and then it doesn't work... just stays on login page

perhaps php code injection?

ehh I don't think cyberstart will do things that complex
`https://118.279.0.1/login?potato=%3Croot%3E`
using potato instead of user doesn't work, meaning it must be my way.

Apparently you need lowercase 
`https://118.279.0.1/login?user=%3croot%3e`

uppercase is supposed to work...
oh well
