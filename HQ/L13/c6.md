wait... we are allowed to use `gdb` the whole time?!?

(stack smashing is kind of like memory overwrite)

gdb isn't too easy right now, I'll switch to ghidra

The title... Binary Memories

skipping the place that causes the crash doesn't work hmm...

![[Pasted image 20211231224521.png]]
interesting, the `sse` register seems to contain some data
they all contain integers though

*maybe I should do some research about the `gdb unscramble`*
https://openbabel.org/wiki/Developer:Testing

it doesn't do anything...
ughh



I tried a lot of things - jumped across the part that was causing ![[Pasted image 20211231232508.png]]
it seems that the program does write to memory... 
I'm going to get a tool to see 	

Perhaps I should just use GDB and see what the `sse` stuff is


## A month later...

Alright, gonna retry
![[Pasted image 20220324165927.png]]
ghidra shows that the program strcats stuff so I'm gonna break near the end so I can read the memory (the program pushes push to `eax`)
![[Pasted image 20220324165842.png]]
`info registers` is `i r` command
![[Pasted image 20220324165845.png]]
read `eax` register as string 

got the flag!

Apparently I was supposed to use ltrace here?
