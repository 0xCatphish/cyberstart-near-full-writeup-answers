#reverseengineering 

this one's tricky

I spent some time analyzing the disassembled code, and I was able to bypass the anti debugger stuff by making a breakpoint just before

Then `set $eax=0` in gdb



# A year later...

Patch this to 1 instead of -1 to enable debugging!


Save the file and now we get a patched binary.

disassemble the main function.

we see that memcpy is executed on `0x56555860`

set a breakpoint there!

when we are calling memcpy, the source address is `$esi`
`$eip` tells computers what to execute next.

![[Pasted image 20230401154819.png]]
Setting `$eip` to `$esi` would execute the address where `$esi` is once we continue operation. 

![[Pasted image 20230401154842.png]]
that didn't work...

![[Pasted image 20230401154856.png]]
delete that breakpoint to stop monitoring there.

![[Pasted image 20230401154914.png]]

now it works when we continue!

I learned quite a bit from this challenge.
