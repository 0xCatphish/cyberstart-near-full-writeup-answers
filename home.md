Have fun with the answers!

The answers aren't fully complete though. Only the higher level challenges are properly documented while the lower levels are not documented at all. 
This is because I was too lazy to document them. Besides, you should be able to do them yourself anyway. 
More difficult challenges like Trail by File are here though, so you can go learn from it if you'd like. 

I'm hoping I can find someone with all the archived challenges and files/executables from Cyberstart, because I didn't save them. 
Please contact me in my discord server if you happen to have saved the challenges.
